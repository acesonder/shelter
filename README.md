PURPOSE:
I want to feel seen. Like my story matters. If there’s a place where I can learn about what I’m going through or see that others made it out, it would help me believe I can too. Sometimes, I just need to know I’m not the only one struggling.

PURPOSE:

PURPOSE:
I don’t even know what’s out there, let alone how to apply. I just want someone to show me where to go without making me jump through hoops. If there’s one system that can help me find help fast, I’ll use it. I just need direction.

PURPOSE:
There are nights I just need someone to talk to, even if I don’t know what to say. I’m not ready to walk into a center, but I’d message someone. Especially if I knew they’d actually listen. I need a safe way to ask for help without judgment.

Build a comprehensive, production-ready web application for “OUTSINC – Outreach Someone In Need of Change.” This application is the centralized hub that integrates multiple specialized platforms to support individuals in need, including services for case management, client intake, referrals, and analytics. The entire system should be built using PHP for backend logic, MySQL as the database, HTML/CSS for the frontend, and minimal JavaScript (primarily for UI interactions like dropdown menus and subtle animations). The design must be modern, responsive, and visually engaging with smooth animations, 3D hover effects, shadows, and clear iconography (using FontAwesome or a similar icon library).

### **Project Overview and Objectives**

- **Application Name:** OUTSINC (Outreach Someone In Need of Change)
- **Purpose:** To provide a centralized, integrated platform that connects individuals to various support services via multiple interrelated systems. OUTSINC acts as the “hub” for our ecosystem, which includes:

  - **LINK:** A seamless referral network connecting clients to community services.
  - **BLES:** A specialized platform focused on addiction recovery and client intake.
  - **ASK:** A real-time chat and support system for immediate guidance.
  - **ETHAN:** An analytics and tracking platform to monitor case outcomes.
  - **Footprint:** A unique tool for tracking the impact and sustainability of our services.
- **Goals:** To deliver a unified and accessible experience for outreach workers, case managers, and clients by streamlining communication, case tracking, and referrals.

### **Application Components & Features**

- **Forms:**
  - **Client Intake Form:** A dedicated page that collects client data (name, contact info, address, etc.) using responsive HTML forms.

  - An overview of the architecture (frontend, backend, database).
  - File and folder structure.
  - Detailed description of each component and its purpose.

   Prompt: Shelter Management System — Bed Layout & Client Assignment
We are building a web-based Shelter Management System designed to help shelter staff manage client intake, bed layout, case management, and client communications.
Right now, we need a feature that allows staff to visually design and manage the floorplan of beds inside the shelter. Staff should be able to:
* Add beds dynamically (Single, Double, or Bunk beds)
* Drag and drop beds into a customizable floor layout/grid
* Assign clients to beds with restrictions based on:
    * Gender
    * Age
    * Whether the client has a pet (dog/cat)
* Beds should display real-time status: Vacant, Occupied, or Reserved
* Clients with accounts should get portal notifications when they are assigned or moved to a new bed
* Beds should visually update with client info once assigned
* Save the entire floorplan persistently to the backend so staff can return to it at any time
Bonus features include:
* Client and staff messaging system (private or group chats)
* Assessment and case management forms attached to each client
* Templated intake forms for quick client onboarding
* Long-term analytics tracking lifecycle trends in homelessness
The design should be modern, responsive, and very user-friendly. We are looking for developers who are confident in React (Next.js or Vite), Tailwind CSS, Drag-and-Drop libraries (like DnD Kit or React-Beautiful-DnD), and have strong experience with state management and back-end data persistence
